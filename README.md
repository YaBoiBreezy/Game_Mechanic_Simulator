Spend some coins to get an amulet, which gives you 3 attributes of random values 1-10  (health, damage, speed). 
Possible to have one better/equal another in all 3 attributes, in which case weaker one is obsolete, but also possible to have many that are good (1,1,10) vs (10,10,2), So how many can you have total, if you remove any obsolete ones? 1000 possible amulets, check all with recursion
